              A modular and scalable engine that transforms input data into structured, context-aware outcomes.

            <h4>Data Collector</h4>
            <p>
              This component gathers data from various inputsâ€”internal systems, external APIs, or manual uploads. It ensures the data is cleaned, validated, and unified into a consistent format ready for processing.
            </p>

            <h4>Processing Module</h4>
            <p>
              Once the data is collected, the processing module applies analytical functions, extracts patterns, compares historical trends, and interprets structured information based on dynamic rules and definitions.
            </p>

            <h4>Result Generator</h4>
            <p>
              After evaluation, results are compiled into structured objects. These outcomes are designed to be readable, exportable, and integrable into existing systems or user dashboards.
            </p>

            <h4>Policy Checker</h4>
            <p>
              The output is matched against pre-configured business policies. This layer supports logic conditions, exception handling, and real-time checks to ensure compliance and contextual accuracy.
            </p>

            <h4>Update Monitor</h4>
            <p>
              Monitors connected data streams for changes over time. This agent triggers reprocessing as needed to ensure freshness and consistency of results across cycles.

            <h4>Output Sample</h4>
            <p>
              A standard response object generated by the system could look like this:
